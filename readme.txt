Predict Housing Prices (using supervised ML)

The notebook creates a model based on various features from housing market.
It tests various Regressors and Evaluators to do so.

The project was worked out 
in collaboration with Alireza, Annette and Brett.

In order to test the resulting model, we participated in the
kaggle competition "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques"
(https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) 

The notebook is part of the ongoing project in module 7 
of WBS Coding School, Data Science Bootcamp #023.
All rights are reserved according to WBS regulations.

The notebook status is the one used on the kaggle competition.
The notebook does not give a sampmle solution. It makes no claim on accuracy.
